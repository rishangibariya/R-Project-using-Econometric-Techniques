# 📈 R Project Using Econometric Techniques  
## Impact of NEER on International Tourism Receipts (2008–09 to 2019–20)

This project analyzes the relationship between the **Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)** and **International Tourism Receipts** in India using **time series econometric techniques in R**.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Examine the impact of NEER fluctuations on tourism income.
- Apply time series regression methods to economic data.
- Interpret statistical results for policy-relevant conclusions.

## 🛠 Methodology
- **Data Period**: 2008–09 to 2019–20 (annual)
- **Tools Used**: R and VScode 
- **Techniques Applied**:
  - **OLS Regression**
  - **Diagnostic Tests**:
    - Breusch-Pagan Test (for heteroskedasticity)
    - Durbin-Watson Test (for autocorrelation)
    - Ramsey RESET Test (for model specification)

## 📊 Key Findings
- A **significant negative relationship** was found between NEER and international tourism receipts.
- The model passed key diagnostic tests, supporting the robustness of the results.
- Insights were drawn regarding the sensitivity of tourism to currency strength, with implications for exchange rate and tourism policy.

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated
- Time series data handling and visualization in R
- Econometric modeling and validation
- Interpretation of economic relationships in policy context
